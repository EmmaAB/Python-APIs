# Python-APIs
Emma Braden | Homework | Due Wed 22 July, 2020 

This assignment uses Open Weather Map and the python library citypy to collect weather data for several hundred random cities. From this, we run regression analyis to test our hypotheses about weather and its relationship with proximity to the equator. 

To use the code, you must put your API keys for OWM and Google Places in the api_keys.py folder. 

The plots created in WeatherPy_EAB will save to the foler "Images" in "Output." And VacationPy_EAB relies on the .csv exported from WeatherPy_EAB, which is kept in the "Output" fodler as well.
